                        I graduated from the University of California San Diego with a degree in Political Science - Data Analytics. My initial path was in the social science direction, as I am passionate about state and social affairs blah blah blah. Here is some more sentences I will later insert about me and my background in a fun way maybe perhaps I guess.
                        Maybe try to keep in shorter and sweeter.
